Goal
----
A huge challenge in the Cyber Security domain is the information sharing inside and between organizations. 
This platform has as goal to facilitate:
* storing technical and non-technical information about seen malwares and attacks
* automatically creating relations between malwares and events
* storing data in a structured format (allowing automated use of the database for various purposes)
* generating IDS rules that can be imported on IDS systems (network, host)
* sharing the information with other parties and trust-groups
* storing locally all information from other instances

To have a better idea what the platform does have a look at the PDF files in the INSTALL directory.

Documentation
-------------
Make sure you read the documentation in the INSTALL directory.
We are currently consolidating the documentation, so it will be updated often.

This part of the code is a major rewrite of a first version of the codebase.
