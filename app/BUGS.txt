Existing bugs:

- timeout admin_user.
- Somehow there got a user_id 0 in events.
- View User and Events got lost(?), but is still there in 0.2.2

Fixed bugs:

- Fix the "Did you ..." message - path routing.
- some admin routing.
- When loged out by session timeout, re-logging gives an error.
  timeout user (?).
- list servers: error lastpushed/pulledid.
- Can't edit composite attributes.
  attribute with type filename|md5 -> filename, remove |..
- Attachments - incompatible categories should be filtered out.
  add attachment show only categroies with attachment and malware-sample types.
- Accept uppercase MD5 with composite attribs.
- Editing attribute - does not validate.
- When a validation error occurs, can't submit it any more.
  add attribute, non-valide, correct, ´black-holed´.
- view event, edit attribute, no validation.
- add user, some validation error then extra: authkey not defined.
- authError gets displayed before login.
- IE - file download does not work.
  IE, no download (Js) (CakePHP bug #2554 related?)
- uppercases in md5 or sha1 when type filename|md5/sha1 is not lc like type md5/sha1.
- Search - paginate broken.
  search attributes: next page goes to search, search again, then at next page.
- non-printable in no-composite attribute and all input behind it gets lost.
- no paging on event with lots of attributes (over 50% speedup).
- a server containing no MISP gives "XML cannot be read." on publish.
- a server having a non-existing internet name gives 
  "php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known" on publish
  and pull.
- Edit event already published to other servers, then (re)publish does not work
  so no other participating servers have the new edited event.
- An authkey with any length, so less then 40, can be entered.
