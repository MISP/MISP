"5488488d-a4ec-4b40-bd7d-15c7950d210b",1635,"External analysis","text","In this document we analyze a set of 32-bit samples
which represents stage #1 of the complex threat that is
known as Regin. Based on our analysis of the malware’s
functionalities, this part of the Regin threat can be
considered just a support module — its sole purpose
is to facilitate and enable the operations of stage #2
by loading it and making it more difficult to detect by
security products.
Regin’s stage #1 targets the Windows platform and
support various versions of the operating system,
beginning with Windows NT 4.0. Based on our analysis,
the samples may be classified into two categories: “pure”
samples that do not feature any extra, non-malicious
code; and “augmented” ones which feature malware
code as part of another device driver. The existence of
“augmented” samples indicates the intention of the
attacker to remain undiscovered for as long as possible.
When activated, samples of Regin stage #1 will
retrieve encrypted content from specific locations of
an already compromised system, map it into kernel
memory and transfer control to it. In terms of technical
sophistication, stage #1’s import resolution process is
of particular interest, as the malware uses the unusual
“trampoline” technique to mask the payload’s access to
API functions.
It is clear that this support component, that represents
the initial stage of a very complex threat, has been
instrumental in securing long-term persistence in the
attacks that made use of this threat.","",,20141210,"","","",""
