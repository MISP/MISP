INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------- for ubuntu 12.04-server

1/ Minimal ubuntu install
-------------------------
Install a minimal ubuntu 12.04-server system with the software:
- OpenSSH server
- LAMP server
- Mail server

You will get some questions, you will probably want to set:
- Postfix Configuration: Satellite system

Make sure your system is up2date:
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade


2/ Dependencies
----------------
Once the system is installed you can perform the following steps as root:

# Because vim is just so practical
apt-get install vim

# Install the dependencies:
apt-get install zip php-pear git
pear install Crypt_GPG    # we need version >1.3.0 
pear install Net_GeoIP


3/ CakePHP
-----------
# Download CakePHP from github
cd /opt/
git clone https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp.git

# You should REALLY make sure that you install security updates of CakePHP when your system is in production !

# If you plan to run multiple MISP instances on a single server, only one installation of CakePHP is needed !

4/ MISP code
------------
# Download MISP using git in the /var/www/ directory. 
cd /var/www/
git clone https://github.com/BeDefCERT/MISP.git 

# Make git ignore filesystem permission differences
cd /var/www/MISP
git config core.filemode false


# Check if the permissions are set correctly using the following commands as root:
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/MISP
chmod -R 750 /var/www/MISP
cd /var/www/MISP/app/
chmod -R g+ws tmp
chmod -R g+ws files
cd /var/www/MISP

##
## FIXME this is not really clean
## 
# Currently you will need to copy the plugins to the CakePHP directory.
cp -r /var/www/MISP/plugins/* /opt/cakephp/plugins/
chmod -R o+rx /opt/cakephp/plugins

5/ Create a database and user
-----------------------------
# Enter the mysql shell
mysql -u root -p

mysql> create database misp;
mysql> grant usage on *.* to misp@localhost identified by 'XXXXXXXXX';
mysql> grant all privileges on misp.* to misp@localhost ;
mysql> exit

# Import the empty MySQL database from MYSQL.sql 
mysql -u misp -p misp < INSTALL/MYSQL.sql


6/ Apache configuration
-----------------------
# Now configure your apache server with the DocumentRoot /var/www/MISP/app/webroot/
# A sample ghost can be found in /var/www/MISP/INSTALL/apache.misp

cp /var/www/MISP/INSTALL/apache.misp /etc/apache2/sites-available/misp
a2dissite default
a2ensite misp

# Enable modules
a2enmod rewrite

# Restart apache
service apache2 reload

# We seriously recommend using only SSL ! 
# Check out the apache.misp.ssl file for an example


7/ MISP configuration
---------------------
# Configure the fields in the files located in /var/www/MISP/app/Config/:
database.php : login, port, password, database
bootstrap.php: CyDefSIG.*, GnuPG.*
core.php : debug, Security.*

# and make sure the file permissions are still OK
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/MISP/app/Config
chmod -R 750 /var/www/MISP/app/Config


# Let MISP know where the CakePHP libraries are located by editing the file app/webroot/index.php and setting (on line 59):
	define('CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH', '/opt/cakephp/lib');


# Generate a GPG encryption key.
mkdir /var/www/MISP/.gnupg
chown www-data:www-data /var/www/MISP/.gnupg
chmod 700 /var/www/MISP/.gnupg
sudo -u www-data gpg --homedir /var/www/MISP/.gnupg --gen-key
# Recommended key type: RSA (sign only)
# The email address should match the one set int he bootstrap.php configuration file

# And export the public key to the webroot
sudo -u www-data gpg --homedir /var/www/MISP/.gnupg --export --armor YOUR-EMAIL > /var/www/MISP/app/webroot/gpg.asc



# Create the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) tables and content:
cd /var/www/MISP/app
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/cakephp/lib/Cake/Console"
cake acl create aco root controllers
cake AclExtras.AclExtras aco_sync    
# You might get an 'Warning Error: Argument…'
# however if it ends with 'Aco Update Complete' it should be OK


Now log in using the webinterface:
The default user/pass = admin@admin.test/admin 

Execute the last installation script by entering the following url into your browser (watch out for capitalisation!):
[MISP url]/events/generateArosAcos

For example, if your MISP installation is located at "https://www.myveryownmisp.com",
then this is what you need to enter: "https://www.myveryownmisp.com/events/generateArosAcos"

Don't forget to change the email, password and authentication key after installation.



UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------

To be sure, dump your database before updating.

CyDefSIG from 0.2.2 to 0.2.3 needs a database migration and population.
This is done executing /var/www/cydefsig/app/Console/shell/migrate-0.2.2-0.2.3.sh
and answer (y)es to all the questions asked
and afterward run http://<host>:<port>/events/migratemisp11to2/<your org>
with <your org> being MIL.BE or NCIRC where appropriate.

Import the regexp data in /var/www/cydefsig/app/MYSQL.regexp.sql using phpmyadmin or mysql>.


Recommended actions
-------------------
- By default CakePHP exposes his name and version in email headers. Apply a patch to remove this behavior.

- You should really harden your OS
- You should really harden the configuration of Apache
- You should really harden the configuration of MySQL
- Keep your software up2date (MISP, CakePHP and everything else)
- Log and audit
