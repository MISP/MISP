  BERT]

  There is still much work to be done. But we are on the road.

  Ideally, and in order to avoid code dupplicates, we should have some utility functions to generate a proper and accessible yes/no icon, an accessible icon link, etc. This would prevent the code from being filled with "aria-label" tags, since the "title" and "aria-label" properties are nearly always the same.

  ### Work environment

  | Questions                 | Answers
  |---------------------------|--------------------
  | Type of issue             | Documentation Update
  | OS version (server)       | CentOS
  | OS version (client)       | Ubuntu, ...
  | PHP version               | 7.1
  | MISP version / git hash   | 2.4
  | Browser                   | If applicable

  ### Expected behavior
  Follow procedures to install, with no errors.

  ### Actual behavior
  Error to create ssl keys, while following procedures.
  The steps to create openssl private keys on line 335 point to file in /etc/pki/tls/certs/misp.local.key, while later in line 338 it looks for file in /etc/pki/tls/certs/misp.local.key.

  regardless of its actual value.
- Fixes variable initialization inconsistency in Server push.

- [API] CSV ignore flag restored to old behaviour. [iglocska]

  - if not set, only return published events / to_ids flagged events by default
  - setting ignore:0 will result in the default behaviour

  being pushed. [iglocska]
- [objects] Fixes issue #3874. [iglocska]

- [stix2 import] Taking Relationship objects target_ref as uuid.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Better than using the Relationship id that is not
    going to be  represented in MISP
  - We directly have the uuid of the object that will
    receive an Object Reference
- Fixes attribute popup UI issues with expansion. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- [stix2 import] Excluding patterns with any of some linking words.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Since those patterns contain linking words we do
    not know how to map, we do not even try to parse
    them and only stix2-patterns will be created
    from them
- [stix 1&2 export] Making initiation lists immutable. [chrisr3d]

  - Lists only used for mapping should be immutable
    since they are not modified. Thus declaring as
    tuples is more appropriate
- [doc] Typo in index for Tsurugi Linux. [Steve Clement]
- [stix2 import] Better selection of objects to parse in object_refs.
  [chrisr3d]

  - It is not nececssary to call parsing functions on
    reports in object_refs because they are already
    parsed through the loop iterating through reports
- [stix2 import] Using Report attributes instead of dictionary keys.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Also improved the loop iterating through reports
- [stix2 import] Try-catching Report objects creator reference.

- [stix export] Fixed function header missing self attribute. [chrisr3d]
- [stix import] Using standard error instead of standard output for
  missing types in mappings. [chrisr3d]
- [stix import] Related objects parsing. [chrisr3d]

  - Not only for observables as before, but also for
    observable objects in indicators
- [stix import] Using subclasses + Support of STIX coming from multiple
  MISP events. [chrisr3d]

  - Using subclasses here allowed us to simplify some
    variables declarations and to reuse some functions
  - STIX coming from multiple MISP events refers to
    STIX files created via the MISP to STIX export
    that can include multiple MISP events

- [galaxy] added collection uuid capture. [iglocska]
- [view] Added uuids to galaxy cluster view. [iglocska]
- [stix export] Avoided putting Incident object as attribute everywhere.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Incident is now a class attribute
  - It also let us make the function parsing some
    not really common attribute types lighter by
    putting a conditionnal statement in another
    function
- [stix export] Made 'header_comment' a list so we don't overwrite the
  value. [chrisr3d]

  - There should only be one attribute matching the
    condition per event, but it is juste to be sure
- [thumbnail] Thumbnail visualisation broken on proposals, fixes #3793.
  [iglocska]
- [server] Allow certificates to be uploaded with other extensions
  besides .pem, fixes #3797. [iglocska]

    objects, we test if the field is there before
    trying to use its value

  without report object. [chrisr3d]

- [stix2 import] Made NetworkTraffic objects import include all the
  possible cases. [chrisr3d]

  - We were potentially missing some DomainName
    or IP Address objects data, when it is not
    a reference of the NetworkTraffic object.
  - Now we look if we still have some of these
    objects that did not have been parsed, and
    in that case, parse them.
- [stix2 import] Quick change on event loading. [chrisr3d]

  - Specifying the encoding within the file opening
  - Allows to get rid of 1 'encode()' call
- [stix2 import] Better parsing for objects that can be imported as
  either ip-port or network-socket. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Supporting STIX 2 files with no report object.
  [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Moved the remaining parsing functions from the mapping
  script to the main script. [chrisr3d]

- [stix2 export] Fixed enumeration errors handling. [chrisr3d]

  - More specific exception types
  - Removed useless try/catch statement
- [stix2 export] Fixed attributes data parsing. [chrisr3d]

  - With json format, base64 & encode/decode
    operations are no longer needed since the base64
    string is already displayed in data

  Fixing import for cases like:
  - single process without parent or child

- [stix2 import] Added missing uuid fields to attributes and objects

- [stix2 import] Quick clean-up. [chrisr3d]

  - Using MISPObject class & attributes instead of
    adding a MISP object dealing with a dictionary

    ditionary keys
  - Removed useless 'continue' statement
- [stix2 import] Parsing file objects in a more generic way between
  classes. [chrisr3d]
- [stix2 import] Moved file object parsing function into the subclass.
  [chrisr3d]

  - Because it is only called by functions of this subclass
- [stix2 import] Removed useless function. [chrisr3d]
- [search] Multiple lines didn't correctly get parsed as separate values
  in the attribute search. [iglocska]
- [workers] manage workers by default defaulted to false (should be
  true) [iglocska]
- [API] Further fixes to the query builder. [iglocska]
- Travis import/export. [Raphaël Vinot]
- [API] Further fixes to the tag handling. [iglocska]

  This is enabled by default, which replicates the current behaviour of having controls to start, stop and restart workers in the server settings page.
  When set to disabled, these controls are hidden, which allows server administrators to manage the worker processes externally, e.g. via systemd.

- Add: [restSearch] STIX 1 & 2 export for restSearch. [chrisr3d]

  Features to be merged:
  - Export of multiple MISP events
  - Fetching events and writing them into files, each
    file containing at most a number of attributes
    defined by a limit
  - Each file is then parsed instead of parsing each
    event individualy, which reduces the number of
    times the python scripts are called, reducing
    the execution time of the overall process
  - The result is then returned as on single file
    read and displayed

  Fix broken timestamps by using 24 hour clock and ISO 8601 date format
- Fix broken timestamps by using 24 hour clock and ISO 8601 date format.
  [Daniel Roethlisberger]

  The event view shows a wrong "Last change", e.g. "2018/08/23 06:01:45"
  for "2018/08/23 18:01:45".  The same problem affects the timestamp in
  the XML generated by IOCExportTool.php.  Fix by correcting the PHP
  date() code "h" to "H".

  While here, also switch to a clearer ISO 8601 date representation for
  "Last change", using dashes instead of slashes for separation of year,
  month and day.

    - extensions: list of dictionaries with existing extensions created by the user's org (containing the id, uuid, info fields)

  - The algorithms implementing this should prioritise as such:

  1. Check if user can edit the event (strategy == edit) - if yes, edit
  2. If no, check if extensions exist - if yes, edit one of those
  3. If no, create a new extension to the original event
- [sync] Added flag to avoid using the proxy. [iglocska]

- New APIs to add/remove orgs and servers from sharing groups, fixes
  #2888. [iglocska]

  - added functions to manage the additions/removals of objects from sharing groups
  - the following APIs are included:
    - /sharingGroups/addOrg/[sg_id]/[org_id]/[extend]
    - /sharingGroups/removeOrg/[sg_id]/[org_id]
    - /sharingGroups/addServer/[sg_id]/[server_id]/[all_orgs]
    - /sharingGroups/removeServer/[sg_id]/[server_id]

  - All parameters are optional and can instead be passed as JSON objects such as:

    {
      "org_uuid": "55f6ea5e-2c60-40e5-964f-47a8950d210f",
      "sg_id": "49",
      "extend": 1
    }

  - The API is extremely flexible with how to name objects, the following parameters are allowed:
    - Organisations:
      - org_id (The organisation's local instance ID)
      - org_uuid (The organisation's global UUID)
      - org_name (The organisation's identifier as known to the curent instance)
    - Server:
      - server_id (The server's local instance ID)
      - server_url (The URL of the server)
      - server_name (The local name of the server as assigned when adding the server)

  The sharing groups can also be addressed by ID or UUID.
- Allow overriding the action names in the stringified restresponse
  messages. [iglocska]

  - for example: 'addOrg' => 'add Organisation to'

  [iglocska]

  - Only site admins and sharing group editors can see organisation lists
    - this includes the org index and various statistics

- Expose the Sharing Groups to the API, fixes #2767. [iglocska]

  - Add/Edit/Index/View now exposed to the API
  - rework of the sharing group capturing process

  - various fixes to edge cases
  - descriptors to the add/edit APIs via restresponse

  - Operation "Just relaxing and looking at stuff for the baby online" - the x-mas covert development patch(tm)

    - removed the build in counter cache for incrementing attribute counts on events in favour of a more lightweight solution
    - performance gains on test data set: 50+ seconds -> 32 seconds

  - Greatly improved attribute index / attribute search performance
    - fixed an issue that caused the lookup to avoid using indeces
    - performance gains on test data when paginating: 11 seconds -> 1 second
- Add hybrid analysis to the freetext import tool, fixes #2797. [Andras
  Iklody]
- Bump PyMISP. [Raphaël Vinot]
- Show x more attributes collapse toggle on the attribute correlations
  now in brackets so people don't accidentally mix the count up with

v2.4.83 (2017-12-06)
--------------------

New
---
- Various improvements to the CSV export. [iglocska]

  - The @FloatingCode and @ilmoka care package
  - Improved CSV performance for instances with large number of events

  - Added attribute tags to the output of the CSV export
- Add restrictions for e-mail addresses to certain domains. [iglocska]
- Add attribute tag filters to the fetchEvents() functionality.
  [iglocska]

  - tag filters now filter on:
    - all events cotaining matching tags on event + attribute level (positive lookup)
    - all events not containing matching tags (negative lookup)
    - filter attributes within a matched event for blocked attributes (negative lookup)

  - moved tag filtering to subquery filtering - should improve performance massively on larger instances when filtering on tags

  - first round of implementations, more on the way
- Various improvements. [iglocska]

  - use the feed uuid caches to link directly to affected MISP events
  - various UI improvements
  - Feed preview pagination / POSTed event ID filters added
- Add the possibility to limit fields for the CSV export via POST
  requests. [iglocska]
- Added mac-address and mac-eui-64 attribute types. [iglocska]
- Added full audit logging to ZMQ and Syslog, fixes #2635. [iglocska]

  - syslog now includes all audit log entries and it's separated into proper severity levels
  - ZMQ logging and syslog logging are both optional features
- Added phone number recognition to the freetext import tool. [iglocska]

  - also, changed the massaging of phone number type attributes to replace 00 with +
- Include user action in zmq. [iglocska]
- Added logging to galaxy attach/detach tasks. [iglocska]
- Push the action for user updates/creations/logins along with the user
  object to the ZMQ channel. [iglocska]

Changes
-------

- Bump PyMISP, again. [Raphaël Vinot]
- Bump PyMISP. [Raphaël Vinot]
- Wip. [chrisr3d]
- Make misp to stix export work with MISP json formatted. [chrisr3d]
- Push MISP json formatted events to the stix exporter (pending rework)
  instead of the direct output of fetchEvents() [iglocska]
- Push the full user object to the ZMQ feed. [iglocska]

Fix
---

- Added db changes needed for the user domain restrictions along with
  restricting the user self edit action. [iglocska]
- Fixed an issue where proposal quick edits didn't work for normal
  users, fixes #2685. [iglocska]
- Fixed update warninglists button being available to non site admin
  users. [iglocska]

  - functionality was blocked by ACL, but button shouldn't be shown in the first place
- Block the addition of same type/category/value attributes in one shot
  to the same event. [iglocska]

  - via the /events/add api
- Enforce server push rules on a sync user when viewing the events.
  [iglocska]

  - user not seeing the data is a side-effect, not the intended effect
  - serves to enforce the synchronisation rules
  - sync user can still view the hidden attributes via attribute searches etc. Whether we want to remove this in the future is still to be decided, but for now the sync enforcement is the only intended effect.
- Mac-eui-64 not accepted by stix validator. [chrisr3d]

  By the way, it is accepted by the validator at creation..

    - sharing group editor user has to manually add an organisation to the list that has javascript in the org name
    - only vulnerable view is the editor itself, so the impact is limited to
      users that manually add organisations with malicious names to the list themselves / edit such sharing groups

  Fix gpgv2+ key generation
- Fix gpgv2+ key generation. [Phi|eas |ebada]

  This resolves failing of gpgv2 key generation with the following error message:
  ```
  gpg: agent_genkey failed: Permission denied
  Key generation failed: Permission denied
  ```

  # Explanation
  gpgv2's `pinentry-curses` requires access to a current `tty`. If you `su` or `sudo` between users, your tty's permission will stay the same as the initial login user (see illustrating below). You could, in general, work around issues like this by:
   - `old_perms=$(stat -c "%U:%G" $(tty)); chown "www-data:tty" "$(tty)" && { sudo -u www-data gpg --gen-key; chown "${old_perms}" "$(tty)"; }` (uncertain security implications and won't probably work)
   - starting screen/tmux within the newuser and then running `gpg --gen-key`
   - starting a script session

  But first point can't really be recommended, latter two will fail because www-data login shell is `/usr/sbin/nologin`.

  Just for illustrating the problem better for you:
  ```
  ssh alice@somehost:
  stat -c "%U:%G $(tty)" $(tty)
  alice:tty /dev/pts/1
  su - root
  stat -c "%U:%G $(tty)" $(tty)
  alice:tty /dev/pts/1

Fix
---
- Removed a duplicate ACL entry. [Iglocska]
- Clusters added don't have the exportable field set on the tag and
  because of that they don't show up on the API. [Iglocska]
- Updated to the latest version of PyMISP. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Moved requeue of pull scheduled job to the front. [Iglocska]
- Fixed missing publish flag in restsearch. [Iglocska]

- Removed an accidentally added edit button. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly reported a feed update to have failed
  when not using delta-merge mode. [Iglocska]

  - the issue was that in the case of a feed update to a fixed event without delta merge, MISP tried to insert all parsed attributes, which correctly automatically blocked duplicates
  - however, since these attributes were blocked by the validator, the feed fetcher reported that the fetch didn't succeed as it contained validation errors

  - this fix simply runs non-delta merge mode updates through the comparisons to the existing event, removing duplicates in advance
- Fixed an issue that prevented the feeds from working in CSV mode if no
  value field was set. [Iglocska]
- Removed invalid entry in writeable file diagnostics. [Iglocska]

- Merge pull request #1726 from liviuvalsan/bro_export_improvements.
  [Andras Iklody]

  Performance improvements, bug fixes and new features for the export to Bro
- - Performance improvements when exporting a large number of attributes
  into Bro format. - Fixed file header formatting for the export to Bro
  format (tabs used consistently). - Computing the time needed for
  generating the export to Bro format when done using a background job.
  - When generating the Bro export from the UI all the attributes are
  generated in one single text file similar to the CSV export instead of
  a zip file with different files inside. - Changed the file extension
  of Bro export files from ".intel" to ".txt". - Removed the allowNonIDS
  option from the Bro export as it doesn’t make sense to have it (Bro is
  an IDS). - Fixed some of the API endpoints which were not accepted
  (ACL issues). - Added support for a list of events that should be /
  should not be included in the export. - Added a new "meta.desc" column
  (added in Bro 2.5, see
  https://www.bro.org/sphinx/frameworks/intel.html) containing the
  description of the event and of the attribute. - Sanitized the
  exported data for Bro. - Fixed a number of value substitutions which
  were imported from Snort/Suricata and which were not working for Bro.
  Did instead substitutions needed for Bro. [Liviu Valsan]

- Fixed some merge issues. [Iglocska]
- Fixes an invalid check allowing user profile modifications to target
  different users within the org. [Iglocska]

- Fixes an issue where attachments / malware samples were erroneously
  coloured white. [Iglocska]

  - could be reused in the future for similar use-cases
- Fixed a UI issue with proposals and links, fixes #1624. [Iglocska]

  - fixed an issue where link type attribute values were not visible due to links being too similar of a colour to the blue background of attributes with indicators
- Better fix than the previous one. [Iglocska]
- Fixed a potential empty event_id field that blocked new CSV feeds from
  being added. [Iglocska]

Fix
---
- Fixes to the ssdeep detection as it was way too loose. [Iglocska]
- Resolved several issues with error handling in the new feed system.
  [Iglocska]
- Removed already removed file that got reverted. [Iglocska]

  - As first committed by @rotanid
  - The file is not used any longer, however removing it causes issues unless we clean the model cache
  - upgrading to a new version will force the cleaning of the model cache, so it's a great time to finally remove it
- Various fixes to the feed system. [Iglocska]

  - allow users to override the IDS flags and keep all attributes pulled from a freetext feed IDS = off
  - UI changes
  - fix to a bug that caused already deleted attributes to be counted as existing ones

- Added missing changes to the javascript file. [Iglocska]
- The JSON schema regarding the related event from Array -> Object.
  [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  - the fetcher was moving proposals within an attribute if the proposal was directed at the attribute (correctly)
  - this left the event proposal list in a non progressive array key format, which lead to a weird situation where the JSON format used string numeral keys in a dict as opposed to the desired list. Nobody in their right mind would ever want that.
  - fixed
- Fixed the incorrect column order on the event index. [Iglocska]
- Fixed the broken check that prevented the sightings count from
  displaying. [Iglocska]

- Even dirtier hack to only replace the STIX_Package object with a
  Package object. [Iglocska]
- Several fixes to the STIX export. [Iglocska]

  - based on the findings of @RichieB2B
- Fixed an issue with the restsearch export potentially incorrectly
  loading all eligible events in one go into memory. [Iglocska]
- Fix an issue where duplicates of auth methods in Security.auth keep
  piling up. [Iglocska]

  - due to a bug, each change in the server settings with an auth plugin enabled would reappend the full list of enabled auth plugins to Security.auth
  - this lead to an exponential growth of the number of entries in the array in the config file

- Use php5-redis package instead of pecl for deb7/ubu14. [Andreas
  Ziegler]
- Submodule updates: force overwrite. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Several fixes to the sharing group behavious. [Iglocska]

  - New setting roaming:
    - Until now, users could unselect "Limit instances to which data in this sharing group should be pushed to"
    - This lead to no servers added to the distribution list, and MISP would simply determine, based on the sync rules, whether the host organisation of the remote instance is eligible for the event
    - This works well in most cases, but in some cases, the local instance is not kept after a sync (aliases for the local instance baseurl vs remote instance's view of the url)
    - In these cases the sharing groups ended up being "unlimited", which was not the intent
    - Generally this shouldn't cause any issues as MISP still requires the sync link's organisation to be directly contained in an SG before it would push the event further
    - However, introducing the roaming setting this can be more clearly defined
    - By default, sharing groups are set to non roaming

  - Some further fixes to the sharing group update procedure for 2.4.49

  - Update the roaming status of existing sharing groups. Local sharing groups with no instances attached will become roaming by default, all others are assumed to be non-roaming
- Add own org of sync user to the Sharing group if the sync user is in
  no way contained in the sharing group. [Iglocska]

  - This situation should normally only occur during a pull when the remote end has a sharing group that allows access for all local orgs
- Progress on the sharing group fix for pulled server based sharing
  groups. [Iglocska]
- Cleanup of some messy function call parameters. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue where a MISP.org setting with non alphanumeric
  characters could lead to invalid STIX document generation. [Iglocska]
- Added taxonomies/delete to the ACL component. [Iglocska]
- Added functionality to remove taxonomies, fixes #1365. [Iglocska]
- Allow null values for taxonomies expanded column, fixes #1354.
  [Andreas Ziegler]
- Tightened lookups for the addTag / removeTag APIs. [Iglocska]

  - no longer a substring match, users have to specify the full tag name
- Add perm_delegate to MYSQL.sql. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Remove SET from sql ADD column statement. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Update mysql structure for 2.4.49 updates. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Specify correct&specific branches in .gitmodules. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Additional chars =~ in mail address regex. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Use different variable name in sub-loop. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Check for correct event uuid and id. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed an issue where an event view by a malformed UUID would result in
  a lookup against the leading numerical value in the malformed UUID,
  fixes #1338. [Iglocska]
- Add warninglist tables to MYSQL.sql. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Use same default value as in AppModel update mechanism. [Andreas
  Ziegler]
- Tag keywords in attribute search filter has issues with an empty
  newline, fixes #1330. [Iglocska]
- Fixed leading/trailing white spaces from breaking the quick filter on
  the event index, fixes #1329. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue with an invalid offset in a comparison when adding
  events. [Iglocska]
- Removed duplicate of the same condition. [Iglocska]
- Filtering on attributes in the event view gives a no attributes
  warning if a tab doesn't contain attributes. [Iglocska]

  - Warning now only triggers if the event doesn't have any attributes in any tabs
- Throw exception for malformed xml file. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Set default value for realFileName. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Throw exception if necessary config cant be read. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed two issues for API add event corner cases, fixes #1298.
  [Iglocska]

  - Correctly handle old style creator org fields ("orgc":orgc_string)
  - Correctly handle new tags with no colour set
- Follow up to the previous patch, same thing for log searches.
  [Iglocska]
- Move case statement and add break. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Fixed an issue with org admins having too much access via the logs.
  [Iglocska]
- Organisations updated with no changes cause erroneous log entries,
  fixes #1099. [Iglocska]
- Allow the export of an empty event in MISP JSON/XML format, fixes
  #1295. [Iglocska]
- Fixed an issue that caused MISP's capture org to disambiguate on the
  name instead of the UUID in some cases. [Iglocska]

  - Due to a fallback mechanism the disambiguation happened on the name if there was no UUID match during the saving of an event instead of creating a new organisation. This was an issue if a remote org changed UUID for example.
- Added domain|ip to the OpenIOC export. [Iglocska]

  - also, the new system should be much easier to extend with new mapping options and is generally a lot cleaner.
  - It would be more complete if Airbus wouldn't have skimped on power outlets on the A380s....
- Rework of the IOC export component, fixes #1292. [Iglocska]
- Ambiguous order field fixed, fixes REST sort of index. Fixes #1266.
  [Iglocska]

  - Fixes an issue where viewing the index of an instance remotely returns no events if sorted on a field.
  - This was caused by some ambiguous field names (such as ID)
  - Fixed by prepending the sorted field name by "Event."
- Fixed an issue with the attribute search incorrectly showing org
  admins the edit button for attributes they don't own, fixes #1278.
  [Iglocska]

  - Also added a way to propose directly from the attribute list / search results
- Empty comments may be added to events #1263. [Iglocska]

  - moved to plain jquery
  - check on back+frontend
  - better responses when adding events
  - fixed an issue with the org_id not being selected for posts
- Fixed a notice error with the attribute pagination. [Iglocska]
- Reverted previous change. [Iglocska]
- Secureauth removed from the config dump. [Iglocska]
- Old upgrade SQL script moved to legacy directory. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Removal of unused file. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Removed the field restrictions from the save() calls in the certauth
  plugin. [Iglocska]

  - apparently cakephp also removes those fields from the beforevalidation hook, meaning that a plugin can potentially escape any data consolidation methods. Not sure if this is intended behaviour by cakephp...
- Fix to an issue with default values not set by the beforeValidate of
  users. [Iglocska]
- Case-insensitive functions calls. [Andreas Ziegler]
- Removed some useless loops, fixes #1231. [Iglocska]
- Reverted the change from addslashes -> escapeshellargs. Will revisit
  the reason it was causing the uploads to fail at a later point in
  time. [Iglocska]
- Multiple values for the restsearch quickfilter added. [Iglocska]
- Proposals now have the correct page title. [Iglocska]

  Casting the sharing_group_id to int value
- Throw exception for sharing group if unauthorised user. [I-am-
  Sherlocked]

  Instead of returning a false value for sharing_group_id, throw an exception if user is not authorised to save modifications to that sharing group.
- Fixing the error caused by a false sharing_group_id. [I-am-Sherlocked]

  If SharingGroup->captureSG returned false indicating it did not save the sharing group, then distribution should be set to 0, and the sharing_group_id to an integer 0.
- Casting the sharing_group_id to int value. [I-am-Sherlocked]

  Saving the sharing_group_id as it is returned by CaptureSG results in Error: [PDOException] SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1366 Incorrect integer value: '' for column 'sharing_group_id' at row 1. Wrapping it in intval will insert the correct int value.

  Allow empty events in pull since they are pushed and importable
- Allow empty events in pull since they are pushed and importable.
  [Steve Fossen]

  Pulling events from a MISP instance didn't match the events imported from that same MISP instance export, nor did it match events published onto that MISP instance and viewable.

  Events without attributes:
      1) can be pushed
      2) imported
      3) exported

  This fix allows them to be pulled to allow consistency with all other actions.

- Don't query every event for proposals, when you don't have permission
  to get proposals. [Steve Fossen]

  A little hacky, but without correct permission, the returning null causes the else case ( Fallback for < 2.4.7 instances )  which then queries every event, for proposals which it doesn't have permission for, so wastes resources on both side.

  - better handling of arrays returned, can still use improvements
- Organisation filter field was case sensitive. Fixed. [Iglocska]

    - taggers can tag events with existing tags
    - tag editors can create / edit / delete tags

  - Fixed several misleading UI elements for tagging
    - tagging users that don't own an event and aren't creators thereof cannot tag them
    - this was enforced before but the UI elements were present and threw errors

  - Migration is automatic
    - all existing tagger roles will automatically become tag editors
    - restricting current roles takes manual admin action, but the functionality should remain unchanged for those that just update
- Case insensitive tagname lookup for the addtag / removetag APIs.
  [Iglocska]
- Reworked the Tag add/remove APIs. [Iglocska]

  - new syntax

v2.4.31 (2016-03-30)
--------------------
- Fix to an issue with the password reset breaking the credentials.
  [Iglocska]

  - The password change forced on users by administrators couldn't save new passwords
  - instead it reset the password to a new random password

  - Resetting the password of such users via the admin interface should fix the issue
  - Alternatively manually setting the password also fixes it
- Re-enabled the missing poporvers on relations. [Iglocska]
- Fixed some issues with the hover enrichment modules. [Iglocska]
- Some refactoring of the freetext tool. [Iglocska]
- Handling of the "freetext" return format via the enrichment modules,
  and error handling fixed. [Iglocska]

  - still a lot of improvements to be done for the detection mechanism

  - error handling for modules, instead of discarding errors they are now shown as a flash message on the freetext import result screen
- Unpublish event if the published flag is not set during an edit.
  [Iglocska]

- Scheduled push incorrectly used the user e-mail address instead of a
  user object to initiate the sync, fixes #1000. [Iglocska]

v2.4.24 (2016-03-07)
--------------------
- Version bump. [Iglocska]
- Better feedback on the sync connection test. [Iglocska]

  - sync users that have not accepted the terms / have had a password reset initiated were redirected to the login page

  - fixes to the issue
    - if a user with automation/sync access uses the API and gets blocked because the terms weren't accepted or there is a pending password change they will be notified in a JSON/XML response

- Slightly better error reporting for GPG diagnostic issues. [Iglocska]
- All events quick filter added to event index, fixes #950. [Iglocska]
- Event Tag numbering fixed. [Iglocska]

  - When fetching events, non exportable tags are blocked at a tag level
  - this results in some empty eventTags, which were correctly unset
  - however, this resulted in an associative array instead of an indexed one in the exports

  - fixed by reindexing the eventTags
- If a user is disabled then he should not receive mass admin e-mails.
  [Iglocska]

  - however, if an admin specifically chooses to e-mail him/her it will still work
- Fixed an issue that blocked the editing of attributes in unpublished
  events if the MISP.unpublishedprivate setting was set. [Iglocska]

- Invalid org capture method lead to orgs with empty UUIDs being matched
  with the first org with no uuid. [Iglocska]
- Add today's date as the event date field if not set. [Iglocska]
- Removal of PGP key generation for travis. [Iglocska]

v2.4.4 (2015-12-30)
-------------------
- Fixes to the first user initialisation. [Iglocska]

  - updated the UserInit command line tool
  - updated the built in user initialisation
- Fixed a typo in the logging that prevented users from being edited,
  fixes #586. [Iglocska]

  - A wrong variable lookup in the logging caused user edits to fail
- Fixes to some of the exports, fixes #798. [Iglocska]

  - Fixed a typo that prevented the event level parameters to be used in the CSV export
  - Fixed an issue where adding the contextual info in a CSV could lead to an invalid CSV if an event info field had a linebreak in it
  - Tuned the performance of time based filtering (until now it would lookup events that should have been excluded in the first place, only to throw them away after the lookup again)
- Initial JSON schema - MISP event (version 2.4) [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Merge branch '2.4' of https://github.com/MISP/MISP into 2.4.
  [iglocska]
- Merge branch '2.4' of github.com:MISP/MISP into 2.4. [Alexandre
  Dulaunoy]

  Solving #786
- Solving #786. [Fafner [_KeyZee_]]
- Merge pull request #796 from FafnerKeyZee/2.4. [Andras Iklody]

  Fix for orgc_id into TemplatesController.php
- Update TemplatesController.php. [Fafner [_KeyZee_]]

  distribution settings, fixes #777. [iglocska]

  - added inherit event as a distribution option for attachments
- Invalid orgc lookup in the template choice menu, fixes #795.
  [iglocska]
- Fixed some issues with the index length of the value fields in the
  MYSQL.sql file, fies #793. [iglocska]

  - Also some additional issues resolved
- Create cached export dirs if they don't exist, fixes #791. [iglocska]

  - until now it was assumed that the dirs are already created
  - just create them if they don't exist
- Invalid lookup of servers for the scheduled pull. [iglocska]

  - it was erroneously looking up servers that have push enabled instead of pull

v2.4.3 (2015-12-27)
-------------------
- Rework of the contributor field, some MYSQL.sql tweaks. [iglocska]

  - added indeces to the MYSQL.sql file
  - contributors now looks for shadow attributes instead of log entries (should make the event view much faster and resolve some timeout issues on sync when the log is massive)

v2.4.2 (2015-12-26)
-------------------
- Fixes a bug on invalid event IDs passed to the STIX export causing
  long execution times, fixes #747. [iglocska]

  - Running a stix export for a specific ID that doesn't exist results in a full STIX export for the user (events visible to the user)
  - This leads for an unnecesarily long export process when a quick export is expected

v2.4.1 (2015-12-26)
-------------------
- Several fixes to the exports, fixes #790. [iglocska]

  - New generic fetch attribute method was mistakenly using the order field as a condition, resulting in some exports only displaying a subset of the data
    - the fix to this fixes the issue described in #790 for text exports
  - Fix to the RPZ exports not working correctly
  - Fix to the horrible performance of RPZ exports
  - Fix to several background worker issues with exports
- Fixed some background worker issues. [iglocska]

  - scheduled pulls would fail because of invalid user object passed
  - invalid permissions checks / org checks would cause the RPZ export to fail when using background workers

v2.4.0 (2015-12-24)
-------------------
- Merge branch 'feature/fastupgrade' into 2.4. [iglocska]
- Index Correlation values. [iglocska]
- Added the reindexing of all tables to the upgrade procedures.
  [iglocska]
- Left off from previous commit. [iglocska]

  editing of events, fixes #788, fixes #784. [iglocska]
- Removed obsolete news page from the side menu, fixes #780. [iglocska]
- CSV memory usage reduction on automation. [iglocska]

  - reduced the number of attributes at the cost of some additional processing time
  - this should reduce very slow processing of large data sets
- Fixed a serious issue with the snort/suricata export which would keep
  appending all eligible attributes over and over to the file instead of
  properly fetching them event by event resulting in a massive export
  file. [iglocska]
- More graceful handling of pgp errors in the emailer. [iglocska]

  - until now the encryption of emails happened in a try catch block
  - however, crypt_gpg throws a fatal error instead of an exception, killing the background worker

  - added an extra checking algorithm that will test the key for a valid encryption key (encryption enabled + not expired)
  - if it's not there, it will just log an error message and continue execution of the other e-mails
- Event tags correctly saved on rest add if they are set in the
  compressed format (event->tag instead of event->eventtag->tag)
  [iglocska]
- When adding/editing a sync user, the choice to limit a user by
  instance settings shows empty lines for instances without a name.
  [iglocska]

  - use the URL in those cases instead
- Editing an event via REST would not capture the tags. [iglocska]

  - if a user is a tagger the tag should be created (if not existing on the current instance) and added to the event
- Merge branch '2.4' of https://github.com/MISP/MISP into 2.4.
  [iglocska]

- MISP screenshot panorama. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Screenshots MISP 2.4 added. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]
- Editing an event with new attributes fails because a new id is not
  assigned correctly, fixes #773. [Iglocska]

  - the process of detecting and editing existing attributes did not account for a case where the uuid is not set for an attribute and therefore should be saved as a new attribute. Fixed
- Fix for an issue with event edits containing a new attribute and it
  not getting an ID as expected. [Iglocska]
- Taxonomies update. [Iglocska]

  - pushing an event with a sharing group that doesn't exist on the remote and that has the sync user included as part of an all_org instance
  - the saving would generate a 405
- Added some fixes to corner cases. [Iglocska]

  - publishing an event when push is enabled to a 2.3 instance failed with an error instead of blocking
  - publishing an event wth the remote instance blocking it due to a sync user sharing group conflict resulted in an exception, handled gracefully now

  - Added mangle-sync towards 2.3
    - gracefully push non sharing group events in a 2.3 format

  - users can now add taxonomy tags separately from normal tags on the event view
  - tag index now shows taxonomy
- Fix to logging causing certain functions to fail on migrated
  installations. [Iglocska]
- Blocked the colour update when the taxonomies are updated. [Iglocska]

  - better to not overwrite the local tag colours unless the tag is refreshed from the taxonomy view. A gree tlp:red looks silly.

- Fix to an invalid json request detection leading to the JSON export
  failing. [iglocska]

  - It seems like relying on the Accept header can lead to the data type detection failing when accessing .json extension views
  - this issue seems to have gone unnoticed since until now the data passed to the json view was the same as that passed to the html view

    - can now view events and attributes remotely
    - can copy over new event to local instance

  - new sync mode (update)
    - allows to only pull changes to events that exist locally already

    - fixed an invalid uuid generation that lead to an exception
    - fixed the attachments for proposals still using the old attachment system that disallows most filenames
    - added the automatic creation of hashes for attachment proposals

  - all e-mails are now also logged here (including the reason of a potential failure)

  - new server settings for default template messages for password resets / new user welcome messages

  fixes #504. [iglocska]

- Further progress. [iglocska]
- Rework of the e-mailing, part 1. [iglocska]

  - just pass the recipient, recipient encryption key collection, body, alternate body if the message cannot be encrypted, subject, reply to address and pgp key for reply to along and the method will do the rest

  - encrypt if possible, check if sending without encryption is allowed, signing, adding attachment for reply to encryption key, using alternate sanitised body if it is enforced for accounts that cannot use encryption is all done in one place

  1. Add / remove tags
  2. quick edit any attribute field if eligible
  3. quickly create a proposal of any attribute field if not eligible to edit
  4. popover attribute creation (also works with batch add)
  5. popover proposal creation (also works with batch add)
  6. delete attributes
  7. accept/discard proposals
  8. mass edit / delete attributes

  Also, replaced the old memberslist, with a small lightweight css/js based one.

  - forms are now dynamically pulled onclick
  - performance greatly enhanced
  - solves the issues with the CSRF protection kicking in if the user edits a field after using the back button
- Next step in the ajaxification. [iglocska]

  - multiselect / multidelete
  - some additional UI changes for the event view
- Next step in the ajaxification of the event view. [iglocska]

  - users can now edit all fields in an attribute whilst on the event page

  - issues left to fix:
  	- tag changes after an attribute change run into CSRF protection
  	- batch add not handled gracefully yet
  	- going back to the event view and editing a field gives users an error message over the CSRF protection - instead, silently check if the page is loaded in a dirty way and refresh the ajax fields silently
  	- quickadd of attributes still missing
- Next step in the ajaxification. [iglocska]
- Two missing view-elements from the previous commit added. [iglocska]
- First commit of the event view ajaxification. [iglocska]

  - pagination of the attribute index within the event view
  - add attributes in a pop-up window

  - number of matches and a percentage of those matches being marked as indicators for IDSes are shown

  - the events are ordered by the percentage of IDS worthy attribute
- Merge branch 'hotfix-2.2.13' into develop. [iglocska]

  hotfix-2.2.12. [iglocska]
- Tweaks To Email Output. [Chris Clark]

  Small tweaks to email formatting to sync up with UI Changes.. also added event title to Subject (questionable if this is something desired globally as it would not be encrypted).
- Update to include starting the BG Workers. [Chris Clark]

  This is present in the upgrade.txt but not the install.txt. I'm not sure if this is the right location for noting this, but in the current version publishing events will not function w/out starting the BG workers.

- Restricting the event log to show only proposals when selecting the
  contributions of an org. [iglocska]

- Fixes with the synchronisation. [iglocska]

  - background pulls fixed
  - now correctly logs changes
  - now correctly updates attributes

  - during the event id pull, the local server already checks the timestamps, removing the ids of events that are not newer than the local version
  - this results in only the event metadata being pulled for all events, and the attributes of only those events that need to be updated are pulled resulting in much quicker pulls

  - Fixed an issue with proposals that got pulled not finding the attribute that they are proposals to (for proposals that belong to an attribute)
- Merge branch 'hotfix-2.2.1' [iglocska]

- Merge branch 'develop' [iglocska]
- Minor corrections in the UPGRADE docu. [Christophe Vandeplas]

  replaced by Event.threat_level_id.       all functionality remains the
  same and users should not see       any difference.       ENUM() used
  for Event.risk is vendor specific and requires       too many hacks to
  play nicely with bake.     - Added default schema file, SQL dumps
  should be avoided since       they make updating/upgrading a pain.

  [iglocska]

  - The height calculation did not take into account gaps between child elements caused by them having several children. This caused a newly added sibling's children to overlap. Fixed by compensating for the vertical displacement between children when returning the height data.
- Merge branch 'hotfix-2.1.20' into develop. [iglocska]

- Merge branch 'hotfix-2.1.8' into develop. [iglocska]
- Upgrade script for 2.1.8. [iglocska]

  - we have introduced the "locked" flag for events to protect events of the original creator from being edited by a sync user

  - IMPORTANT: before running the script below, make sure to create the locked field for the event table (see INSTALL/LOCKED.sql)

  - This script (generateLocked found in the Administrative tools menu) will attempt to set the locked value for existing events to ease the transition

  - The default value for locked is 0, and all events created on the instance should be set to this value

  - events that were synced from another instance should have their locked value set to 1

  - this script checks for local organisations and sets the locked field to 1 for all events not created by them

  - a local organisation, as defined for the scope of this scrips is: an organisation with at least 2 members or an organisation with a single member that is not a sync user.

  - The script is only accessible by site admins and will return a notification about the number of events altered.

- Attribute http-method added - issue #161 fixed. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

  The attribute HTTP method added. By default, the values
  must match the known HTTP method from RFC2616, RFC2518,
  RFC3253, RFC3648, RFC3744, RFC5789, RFC5323. The method
  is case sensitive.
- Terms and conditions separated from the template. [Alexandre Dulaunoy]

- Some changes to the UI. [iglocska]

  - The previous UI changes fixed the top and the bottom bar to the
  viewport

  - It was great for the UI with the debug disabled, but it obstructed the

  - but since all of the role permissions are checked beforefilter in
  appcontroller and saved into a public array, doing a lookup of the
  array saves an SQL call for each permission check.
- Closes #131. [iglocska]

  - Seems like a change removed this functionality since 2.0, fixed

- Removed warning message. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Update to the attribute search. [iglocska]

  - Use ! to exclude terms in the value/id/org fields

  - org search works the same way as value / id now, you can enter several
  terms separated by a newline. Also, adding ! infront of a term will
  exclude the organisation from the results

  - sub string search for organisations
- Consistency in MYSQL database file. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Unify db schema. [Christophe Vandeplas]
- Filter logic reworked. [iglocska]

  - Affects org and info field

  - terms have to be saparated by pipe (|)

  - terms can be terms that will be OR-d or excluded terms that will be
  AND-ed

  - to exclude a term use !

  - A valid filter search for info would be: 'term1|term2|!term3'
  -> this would result in all events with the info field containing term1
  or term2 but not term3
- NOT filter for orgs on the event index. [iglocska]

  - entering for example '!futuremark' would exclude all events created by
  the organisation 'futuremark'
- Email addresses of event creators visible to users if same org.
  [iglocska]

  - On the event index, users can view the e-mail address of the event
  creator, if the event belongs to their own organisation
- Some fixes to the filters event index. [iglocska]

  - siteadmins can now search the creator org instead of the owner org
  (like normal users would)

  - Changed the org search to be a partial match instead of an exact match
- Two small changes. [Iglocska]

  - email of the user creating an event shown if current user's org ==
    event's orgc

  - on export, the check for to_ids will happen outside of the if branch
    that sets extra restrictions of non site admins. Otherwise site-admins
    would accidentally include attributes that aren't iocs.
- Fix to the filters on IE. [Iglocska]

  - old versions of IE didn't handle an incorrect form creation as gracefully as the other browsers

  - forms should not be created within a table unless it's within a <td> (it was
    on <tr> level before). The normal solution would be to encapsulate the
    entire table in a form, but since we have formlinks for the deletes /
    publishes this would get flagged as form tampering by the security
    components.

  - As a fix, filter forms are created separately for the 4 search fields within their <td> now with hidden fields that keep the persistence of the previously
    entered filter terms
- Incorrect line removed from migration. [iglocska]
- Update to the migration. [iglocska]
- First update to the SQL scripts. [iglocska]

  added an e-mail is sent to all subscribing members of the orgc and the
  new field is set to 1
  - Accepting a change resets the field to 0
- Extra access control restriction for reportValidationIssues.

  - SQL scripts tidied up of incorrect junk (from export)

  - upgrade scripts finish gracefully
- Small change to the migration. [iglocska]
- Change to the migration script fixing an error. [iglocska]

  During the structure export of the ACL tables the current increment count
  from the test environment got left in, caused errors when creating a new
  role.
- Instructions for the upgrade. [iglocska]

  - 1st version
- Update to generateCount. [iglocska]

  - generateCount used to just run through all attributes and save them, to
    generate the count. It led to VERY long execution times on larger
    databases (25k+ attributes). With the extra processing that each save()
    does for attributes, this was horribly slow.

  - new generateCount just saves the events based on the number of
    associated attributes, only having to save the events (of which there
    are considerably less).
- More updates to the migration. [iglocska]
- Slight change to generating the ArosAcos. [iglocska]

  - Replaced it with values provided by extra cake queries as the delay for
    fetching the info field through a js rest request was annoyingly slow

  - some coding standards
- Attribute and event access. [Andras Iklody]

  - Updated the check for authorisation to view an event and attribute as
    the system hid some valid combinations (such as a server only attribute
    in a higher distribution level event).
- Regexp validation. [Andras Iklody]

  - an invalid regexp entry could block any event/attribute from being
    entered. Introduced a check on regexp entry to block faulty patterns.

    sanitization isn't needed.

  Iklody]

  - List of new values for the regexp table

  - if the user_id for an event is not set, set it to that of the user with
    the e-mail address of 'cisprotection@ncirc.nato.int'.
- Colouring of search terms works in links. [Andras Iklody]

  - links now have proper colouring to make the found terms more visible
- Some changes to the search. [Andras Iklody]

  - changes to the validation of the results

  - fixes an issue where the escaping of slashes showed up with a //

  - made the found results more visible and case insensitive
- Slight update to the filename regex. [Andras Iklody]

  - accept extensions from 2 to 4 characters in length
- Fixed some regex issues and file name validation. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed an issue that caused attribute values to be converted to 1 on
    save in case of an empty regexp table

  - Filename validation now happens via whitelisting instead of filename
    sanitization
- Checkbox / radio misalignment. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed an issue with IE interpretting an unset padding value for
    checkboxes / radio selects as a good reason to give it some high value.

  - Export didn't take into account distribution rules, should be fixed

  - Fixed a bug with editing attributes
- Still issues with the attribute search. [Andras Iklody]

  - should be ok now
- Fix to the updated search attributes. [Andras Iklody]

  - issue on the live server with the search field left empty, fixed
- Several things (search, migration) [Andras Iklody]

  - Changes to the default setting for non private events after migration

  - search attribute update to be able to exclude events
- Updated the migration script (SQL) [Andras Iklody]

  - Script updated based on the issues during testing

  - Changed the file upload/downoad mechanism.
- Composite type change. [Andras Iklody]

  - composite type's value not exploded if value1 already set (to hopefully
    fix issues with the migration tool)
- Missing migration sql updates. [Andras Iklody]
- Regexp fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  - Regexp replacement didn't actually change the data in the object. Fixed.

  - comma at the end of line missing in SQL file
- Changes to the distribution handling of attributes. [Andras Iklody]

  - Only the creating org of the event can change the distribution of
    attributes

  - Attribute distribution setting are only pushed on edits if they were
    manually changed (so that the distribution level of events on the
    creating server doesn't get degraded by an edit and push of the event at
    a synced server when using connected community settings).

  - slight change to the batch attribute search, the search terms are only
    echoed up to 9 terms to prevent the mass echoing of a long list
- Some updates to the migration script. [Andras Iklody]

  - Getting it up to date
- Attribute edit fixed. [Andras Iklody]

  - Editing attributes caused an error because the uuid was not passed back
    from the form (and it is used to find the attribute locally for rest)

  - UUID is now used from the read attribute for non rest users. In the long
    run it would be cleaner to not allow non rest users to reach that part
    of the code.
- Minor changes. [Andras Iklody]

  - some changes to the access control

  - re-renabled regexp and blacklists, will need a closer look though

  - editing a role should update ACL

  - some other minor things
- Previous commit was slightly off. [Andras Iklody]

  Changed the placing of the unset, as it broke the push of attachments.
  Should be fine now.
- Major bug with attributes disappearing during sync. [Andras Iklody]

  Found a bug where an instance that has a lower attribute count pushing to
  another would cause the attributes with equal attribute ID to get
  overwritten with the pushed ones. Unsetting the attribute ID before the
  push fixes this.
- Update to the menu. [Andras Iklody]

  - minor cosmetic change
- Reworked the sync / release control. [Andras Iklody]

  - Fixed issues with the sync
  	- Secondary publishes on remote servers failed
  	- Introduced new fields in events to stop backward traverse of
  	  edit information that lead to low performance and eroneous
  	  distribution information updates when more than 2 servers were
  	  linked
  	- Deletion of an attribute now deletes on remote servers

  - Changes to the event ownership
  	- Original creator org now noted in the event itself
  	- Only original creator org can change distribution
  	- Events will show up with the original creator org for users
  	  (admins can see both that and the owner of the event on the
  	  local instance)
  	- Server.organization now used in junction with the connecting
  	  user's org and the instance's org (from the bootstrap) to
  	  determine distribution flow control and access rights

    removed, etc.
- Missing file from the last commit. [Andras Iklody]

  Missed a file from the package
- Fixes to access rights, some sanitization, etc. [Andras Iklody]

  - Admins cannot manually change anyone's authkey, they need to generate a
    new one via the reset link

  - Some pages could be accessed by changing the url - fixed (though needs
    further testing)

  - Edited a change in the manual that may have been confusing

  - Some changes to the way ACL is set up - still needs more work

  'WINNT'

  Also removed autofill for the login field
- Corrected a typo preventing the sync from working. [Andras Iklody]
- Changes to the admin org access and sanitization. [Andras Iklody]

  Date: Fri, 7 Dec 2012 13:30:10 +0000
  in this there is a complaint about the RESTfull sync workings.
  the email hints about 2 possible options:
  i) RESTfull add event without attributes (conform the web interface)
  ii) RESTfull add event with attributes (more conform the code)

  both are implemented and can be choisen in bootstrap.php by
  Configure::write('CyDefSIG.rest', 'ii') or 'i'.

  pull-up all changes to the db model,
  so MYSQL.txt has all needed for a clean start db.
- Contact reporter. [noud]

  Submit to org button in the contact reporter view – changed it
  to just submit, having the tickbox to contact a person only + the submit
  to org button seems a bit confusing.
- Distribution. [noud]

  removed No push as a distribution.
- Logout. [noud]

  moved logout from footer right to Global Actions.
- Distribution. [noud]

  now attributes do work same for pull like push.

  Following events are now being logged:
  1. Adding a new user.
  2. Deleting a user.
- Users. [noud]

  invited by filled.
- Audit log. [noud]

  Search logs allows for searching for “publish” as Action. Publish is
  saved in the logs as an edit with the change being publish () => (1).
  Now, edit (so unpublish) is still edit and publish is action.
- Audit log. [noud]

  Search logs and paging now works as expected (conform search
  attributes).

- Distribution. [noud]

  border="1"-testleftover removed.
- Distribution. [noud]

  if distribution is All, so not displayed in an index nor in attributes
  per event, there is missing a line-part in IE.
  Did add 1 space for All, this will maybe display the line-part again.
- Dropdowns. [noud]

  let the risk dropdown in event add and edit behave like the other
  dropdowns.
- Dropdowns. [noud]

  We have a rule(?), if so:
  $isAclAdd || $event['Event']['user_id'] == $me['id'].
  This rule, i "have add right OR the event was and is already mine".
  if that's correct, that was forgotten in the actions_menu.ctp.

  Add "Pull only" as a sharing state where,
  everybody does see an event, is pullable,
  but will never be pushed.

  Has a generatePrivate for db conversion now.
- Private. [noud]

  Private events are true private and
  running a server in 2 modes (private and sync),
  so real private (red) or private to server (amber)
  or full distributable (green).

  Mind this needs a change to tables events, attributes and correlation.
  These are in MYSQL.private.sql.
- Merge branch 'master' into develop. [noud]
- Blackhole. [noud]

  i have an idea this blackholeCallback seems to overcome a lot of
  blackhole situations we got.
  Notably during deleting multiple events from the index,
  this improved not getting a blackhole a lot.

- Better placement of plugins (touching RBAC & Audit log) [noud]

  If it's just an existing behavior or lib,
  place it in a plugin directory structure in <cydefsig>/plugins.

  If there is a need to change an extern existing plugin,
  extend the existing plugin by a new plugin in <cydefsig>/app/Plugin.

  This way there is a very clean devision between own and external code.

  During sync and correlation = db,
  an attachment or malware did not get processed into
  Attribute.data, so will not be synced.
  Now, conform other correlation methods being 'default' or 'sql'
  the attachment or malware is synced as well.
  (master has been synced with mil.be not using db correlation,
  so should have the data.)
- NIAS. [noud]

  CyDefSIG.showowner=false, to not show email.

- Sync. [noud]

  The actual logos used for visable flags in Events::index.
- Sync. [noud]

  Sync worked, but we did not know what to do with user_id and org.
  Now, on sync, anonymize the user_id, get the Server.organization and put
  that into Event.org.
  And, display owning flag if Event.user_id or get the Server.logo
  belonging to Event.org (=Server.organization) when Event.user_id is
  empty (=0).

  To this there is organization name and logo in bootstrap and
  other organizations names and logos in Servers.

- Use DS in stead of '/'. [noud]
- Delete (published) event or attribute. [noud]

  Previous, upon delete only on the local server the event or attribute
  was deleted.
  Now, if delete, look for same event or attribute (using it's uuid)
  and delete on remote servers as well.
  Also look and delete if not published, so no dangling/zombie copies
  remain on remote servers.
- Authkey validation bug and cleanup of fixed bugs list. [noud]
- Authkey validation. [noud]

  An authkey with any length, so less then 40, could be entered.
  Now authkey has to have a length of 40 (or higher).
- HIDS exports sorted (and small indention correction). [noud]
- Whitelist not on NidsExportComponent::urlRule. [noud]

  In hindsight, an url should not be excluded given a host or domain name.
- Correlation speedup using AttributesController i.s.o.
  EventsController. [noud]

  We forgot to change some view things using the right controller.
- REST edit Event implementation. [noud]

  Now after publish, edit and (re)publish an event,
  that event will be updated on the other servers.
- Event.user_id. [noud]

  Event.user_id was re-added but we still missed some,
  so an added event would get user_id set to zero.
  Now Event gets the correct user_id again from
  the person logged in and adding.
  (lateron this must not be used during sync.)
- Whitelist. [noud]

  Mention the whitelist for NDIS export on Export page.
- Whitelist. [noud]

  An admin can maintain a whitelist of host, domain name and ip numbers.
  In the NIDS export lines containing whitelist items are commented out.
- Correlation performance gain. [noud]

  in Config/bootstrap.php add
  Configure::write('CyDefSIG.correlation', 'sql');

  possible values:
  - default, like it was
  - db, correlation in database
  - sql, selection on attributes i.s.o. per attribute
    (sql improvement possible if result conform db above)

  Network activity, ip-src
  30 class-C network ip addresses
  (7650 tupels) (time in ms)

            default     db    sql

- Bug, unknown server internet name and pull. [noud]

    on pull.
- Sync Servers, error if server no MISP or non-existing hostname. [noud]
- Sync Servers, fix if server no MISP or non-existing hostname. [noud]

  - a server containing no MISP gives "XML cannot be read." on publish.

    "php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not
  known" on publish.
- Export HIDS files with MD5 and SHA-1. [noud]
- (Audit) logs. [noud]

  The writing of the log in User was done by me using calls to the PHP db
  driver (during my second or third day). Very wrong given that is driver
  and db dependant. Now use CakePHPs calls to have abstraction.
- GFI Sandbox upload. [noud]

  If add event, give a GFI Sandbox export file upload field option.
  Unzip, read .xml, add attachment malware, created files and ip-dst.
